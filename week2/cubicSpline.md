Problem description  
Consider approximating $f(x)=1/(1+25x^{2}),x\in [-1,1].$ Let N+1 be the number of nodes.Using cubic spline interpolation, find ùëÅ such that the error of approximation is less than $10^{-10}$

1.Error formula  
For a uniform grid and natural cubic spline interpolation, The error bound is:

$$
\|f - S\|_\infty \le \frac{5}{384} \, h^4 \max_{x \in [a,b]} \big| f^{(4)}(x) \big|
$$  

2.Observertion  
For N=2365, measured max error $\simeq 10^{-10}$.  
For N=23644, measure max error $\simeq 10^{-14}.$  


Natural spline: The boundary condition is $S{''}(-1)=S{''}(1)=0$For the Runge function, this does not match the true curvature at the endpoints, so the spline accumulates error near the boundaries.  
Clamped spline: The boundary condition uses the exact first derivatives $f^{'}(-1),f'(1)$This enforces the correct slope at the endpoints and allows the spline to capture the function‚Äôs behavior more accurately. As $N$increases, the advantage of using the correct derivative information becomes more pronounced
