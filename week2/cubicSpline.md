Problem description
Consider approximating the Runge function. Let N+1 be the number of nodes.Using cubic spline interpolation, find ùëÅ such that the error of approximation is less than 10^{-10}

1.Error formula
For a uniform grid and natural cubic spline interpolation, The error bound is:

$$
\|f - S\|_\infty \le \frac{5}{384} \, h^4 \max_{x \in [a,b]} \big| f^{(4)}(x) \big|
$$

where

$h = \tfrac{b-a}{N}$ is the step size,

$N$ is the number of subintervals,

$S(x)$ is the cubic spline approximation,

$f^{(4)}(x)$ is the fourth derivative of $f$.
